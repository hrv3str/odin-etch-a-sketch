# Etch-a-Sketch Game (JavaScript Version)

This project is a JavaScript implementation of the classic Etch-a-Sketch game. It has been developed as part of the curriculum for the Odin Project, a self-paced online learning platform for web development.

## Description

The Etch-a-Sketch game allows users to draw on a virtual canvas using their mouse or touch input. It simulates the experience of drawing on an Etch-a-Sketch toy, where lines are created by dragging a stylus across the screen. Users can choose different colors and brush sizes to customize their drawings.

## Features

- Mouse and touch-based drawing: Users can create drawings by dragging their mouse cursor or using touch gestures on compatible devices.
- Adjustable brush size: Users can select different brush sizes to vary the thickness of the lines.
- Color selection: Users can choose from a variety of colors to customize their drawings.
- Reset functionality: Users can clear the canvas and start a new drawing.
